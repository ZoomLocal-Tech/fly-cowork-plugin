# SEO Scoring Guide

## How GBP SEO Scores Are Calculated

The Fly agent's SEO score evaluates four key dimensions of a Google Business Profile:

### 1. Business Name (up to 25 points)
- **Keyword presence** — does the business name contain relevant search keywords?
- **Length optimization** — is it descriptive enough without being spammy?
- **Brand consistency** — does it match the real-world business name (Google policy compliance)?

### 2. Description (up to 25 points)
- **Length** — aim for 700-750 characters (Google's max is 750)
- **Keyword integration** — naturally incorporates target keywords
- **Services mentioned** — lists core services/products
- **Location signals** — mentions service area or city
- **Call to action** — ends with a compelling CTA

### 3. Primary Category (up to 25 points)
- **Relevance** — how well does the primary category match the actual business?
- **Specificity** — more specific categories rank better (e.g., "Thai Restaurant" > "Restaurant")
- **Search volume** — categories that match common search queries score higher

### 4. Additional Categories (up to 25 points)
- **Count** — Google allows up to 9 additional categories; more relevant categories = higher score
- **Relevance** — each additional category should represent a real service line
- **Coverage** — categories should cover all major services without redundancy

## What Impacts Local Rankings Beyond the Profile

While the audit focuses on on-profile factors, local rankings are also influenced by:
- **Review volume and velocity** — consistent new reviews signal relevance
- **Review response rate** — responding to reviews (positive and negative) is a ranking signal
- **Citation consistency** — NAP (Name, Address, Phone) must be identical across all directories
- **Website quality** — the linked website's SEO, speed, and mobile-friendliness matter
- **Google Posts activity** — regular posts signal an active business
- **Photos and media** — businesses with photos get 42% more direction requests

## Optimization Priority Order

When improving a profile, prioritize in this order:
1. Fix incorrect primary category (biggest ranking impact)
2. Complete and optimize description (high impact, easy win)
3. Add all relevant additional categories
4. Ensure NAP consistency across citations
5. Set up and respond to reviews
6. Create regular Google Posts
7. Upload quality photos
