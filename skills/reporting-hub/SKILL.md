# Reporting Hub

Generate, compare, export, and deliver comprehensive business performance reports for single locations and entire workspaces.

## Multi-Location Awareness

1. Establish context with workspaces/locations
2. For workspace-level reports, use `mcp__fly-agent__generate_workspace_report`
3. For single-location reports, set default location first

## Workflow: Monthly Report (Single Location)

1. **Full report** — call `mcp__fly-agent__generate_monthly_report` with month (1-12) and year. Includes visibility, engagement, reviews, posts, and rankings
2. **Quick summary** — call `mcp__fly-agent__get_monthly_summary` with month and year for key metrics at a glance

## Workflow: Month-Over-Month Comparison

Call `mcp__fly-agent__compare_months` with:
- `month1`, `year1`: first period
- `month2`, `year2`: second period

Shows changes in key metrics between the two periods.

## Workflow: Workspace Report (Multi-Location)

Call `mcp__fly-agent__generate_workspace_report` with month and year for aggregated performance across all locations.

## Workflow: PDF Export

1. **Check available reports** — call `mcp__fly-agent__get_available_reports` to see what report types can be generated
2. **Generate PDF** — call `mcp__fly-agent__generate_report_pdf` with:
   - `report_type`: "monthly", "audit", "reviews", or "custom"
   - `month` and `year` for monthly reports

## Workflow: Email Delivery

Call `mcp__fly-agent__send_report_email` with:
- `report_type`: the report type
- `email`: recipient email address
- `month` and `year` for monthly reports

## Report Types

| Type | Contents | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Monthly | Full performance metrics, reviews, posts, rankings | Regular client updates |
| Audit | SEO score, profile completeness, recommendations | New client onboarding |
| Reviews | Review stats, sentiment, response rate | Review-focused clients |
| Custom | User-specified metrics and date range | Ad hoc analysis |

## White-Label Branding

All reports and emails should carry the user's branding, not Fly's. Before generating any report or email:

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/branding.json` for default branding config
2. Check for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/branding-{workspace-name}.json` for workspace-specific branding (overrides default)
3. If no branding is configured, suggest: "Run `/setup-branding` to add your agency/brand identity to all reports and emails"

Apply branding to all output:
- **PDF reports**: brand_name in headers (replacing "Fly"), logo_url in header, brand_color for accents, footer_text on every page
- **Emails**: brand_name in subject line, tagline in header, contact_email as reply-to identity, footer_text and website_url in footer
- **Summaries**: header with brand_name, sign off with footer_text

See **`references/white-label-guide.md`** for full branding implementation details.

## Data Freshness & Refresh Cadence

- **Monthly Performance Reports** are generated by Fly's backend on the **7th of each month**.
- **Performance Stats** refresh daily for T to T-14. Reports for the previous month will have complete data after the 7th.
- **Best time to generate monthly reports**: After the 7th, when backend reports are fully updated.
- **Follow-up triggers**:
  - On the 7th of each month → generate and deliver monthly reports to all clients
  - After delivering a report → schedule a follow-up action plan based on the report's recommendations
  - Quarter-end → generate quarter-over-quarter comparison to show long-term ROI

## Quantifiable Outcomes & KPIs

Every report should lead with business outcomes, not raw data:

| KPI | Where to Highlight | Client Impact |
|-----|-------------------|---------------|
| Visibility Growth % | Report header / executive summary | "Your search visibility grew X% this month" |
| Lead Volume Change | Actions section | "You received X more calls/directions/clicks vs. last month" |
| Review Score Trend | Review section | "Your rating improved from X to Y — building customer trust" |
| Ranking Improvements | Rankings section | "You now rank in the top 3 for X keywords — capturing more local traffic" |
| Content Activity | Content section | "X posts published — keeping your profile active and visible" |
| ROI Narrative | Executive summary | "This month's optimization efforts resulted in X% more customer actions" |

## Action-to-Outcome Funnel

Every report delivery should include actionable next steps:

1. **After monthly report** → "Based on this month's data, here are the top 3 actions for next month: [specific recommendations]." Always include at least one action tied to lead generation.
2. **Performance declining** → "We need to address: [specific decline area]. Recommended: [audit/optimize/content push]. Target: reverse the decline within 30 days."
3. **Performance growing** → "Great progress. To sustain momentum: maintain review response rate, continue posting weekly, and monitor rankings for the top 3 keywords."
4. **Month-over-month comparison** → Always frame changes in business terms: "15% more direction requests = ~X more potential walk-in customers."
5. **Client report delivery** → Include a "Recommended Actions for [Month]" section that the client can act on or approve.

**Always end every report with a "What's Next" section** that ties findings to the next `/daily-ops`, `/weekly-ops`, or specific optimization action.

## Agency Reporting Workflow

For agencies managing multiple clients:
1. List all workspaces with `list_workspaces`
2. Load the branding config (default or per-workspace)
3. For each client workspace, generate a workspace report with branding applied
4. Export as white-labeled PDFs and email to respective client contacts
5. Compare to previous month to highlight improvements
6. **Include an "Actions & Recommendations" section** per client — specific, measurable next steps tied to their data
7. **Track month-over-month progress** — show clients the cumulative ROI of your services with trend data
