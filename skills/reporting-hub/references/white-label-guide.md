# White-Label Branding Guide

All reports and emails generated by this plugin must be white-labeled with the user's branding. This ensures agencies, freelancers, and brands present client-facing output under their own identity.

## Loading Branding Config

Before generating any report or sending any email:

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/branding.json` for the default branding
2. If operating within a specific workspace, also check for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/branding-{workspace-name}.json` — if it exists, use it instead (workspace-specific branding overrides the default)
3. If no branding config exists or all fields are empty, prompt the user to run `/setup-branding` first

## Applying Branding to Reports

### PDF Reports (via generate_report_pdf)
When presenting report content to the user or generating reports:
- Replace any "Fly" or "Fly Agent" headers with the configured `brand_name`
- Reference the `logo_url` for inclusion in report headers
- Use `brand_color` for accent colors and chart elements
- Apply `footer_text` at the bottom of every page
- Include `website_url` in the footer alongside contact info

### Email Delivery (via send_report_email)
When sending reports to clients:
- Subject line should lead with `brand_name` (e.g., "Monthly SEO Report — Digital Growth Agency")
- Email body should reference the brand, not Fly
- Include `tagline` in the email header
- Use `contact_email` as the conceptual "from" identity (note: actual sender is Fly's infrastructure, but the branding frames it as the agency's report)
- Footer should include `footer_text` and `website_url`

### Generated Content & Summaries
When the ops commands (/daily-ops, /weekly-ops, /monthly-ops) produce summaries:
- Header the summary with `brand_name`
- Include `tagline` if present
- Sign off with `footer_text`

## Branding in Copy-Friendly Formats

When presenting summaries for the user to copy-paste into their own email/WhatsApp/chat:
- Format with brand_name at the top
- Include a professional sign-off using the configured details
- Example format:

```
[Brand Name] — Weekly SEO Update
[Date]

[Summary content...]

—
[Brand Name]
[Tagline]
[Website URL] | [Contact Email]
```

## Per-Workspace Branding

Agencies managing multiple clients may have different branding per workspace:
- Each workspace can have its own `branding-{workspace-name}.json`
- When operating on a specific workspace, load that workspace's branding
- Fall back to default `branding.json` if no workspace-specific config exists
- This allows an agency to send reports under the client's brand or their own brand per client preference

## No Branding Configured

If branding hasn't been set up:
- Suggest: "Run `/setup-branding` to add your agency/brand identity to all reports and emails"
- Do not block report generation — proceed without branding but mention it's available
